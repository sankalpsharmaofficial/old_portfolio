									<p> 
										Hi my name is Sankalp Sharma and I am a Front-end Software Engineer, I work on the MERN stack . I am passionate about gaining in-depth knowledge of the various engineering topics and applying them to my job. I also have an interest in Photography which has allowed me to see things in different perspectives and has brought out my creative side which then helps me in my work as well.
										Goal to become a successful expert in the field of Software development and Technology by channelizing my technical knowledge and skills to ensure personal and professional growth and to contribute to the prosperity of the organization that I am working for.
										</p>
										
										<p> 
										I am from India and my dad is in the Indian Coast Guard. So I have lived all my life in the various cities of the country. This made me quite a sociable person as I love getting to know more and more people and this process has lead me to have lots of friends all over the country. This also allowed me to see the various cities of the country and experience various cultures and traditions of the different states that I lived in. My parents are originally from Jammu and Kashmir which is the Northern most state of the country and I was born in Chennai a city in the Southern State of Tamil Nadu. I have quite an interest in various sports as I feel I am able to learn a new sport with ease. This has lead me to playing Cricket in the early years of my childhood to playing Football for my school and college. I was also the sports captain of the school during the senior year of high school. I have played table tennis on a state level and also enjoy playing Tennis. 
										</p>
										
										<p> 
										My fascination with Science began at a very early stage in life when I started getting intrigued by the basics of how electricity is produced, what makes machines work so efficiently, more so when I used to find my father flying the helicopter and sailing in ships. I grew up in an environment which was witnessing rapidly changing technological advancements and influencing the life of mankind in every manner.
										</p>
										
										<p> 
											I always wondered about earth’s rotation on its own axis and causing day and night phenomenon and its revolution around the sun leading to setting of four beautiful seasons.  The flight of airplanes across the regions and the continents and the significance of navigational equipment onboard for accurate navigation always fascinated me the most. Similarly the sailing of ship which is large metallic structure floating on the surface of water and moving from place to place thus giving cheapest source of transportation to the mankind, made me wonder about the Archimedes’ principle and its applicability on this beautiful medium of transportation. I would pose basic queries to my father to understand the nuances of the scientific principles which have revolutionized the life on planet earth. And he always tried to explain to me the nitty gritties behind all this in a very simple manner that made me gape in wonder. 
										</p>
										
										<p> 
											I grew up amidst the environment which was surrounded by academicians and professionals which shaped my mind towards pursuing further studies in engineering/ computer science. I bravely decided to read “The Unofficial Guide to Ethical Hacking” in the 10th  grade, and was amazed to read about the concept of hacking. And after reading the book I was sure that I had to take Computer Science in my 11th grade and make it my final choice and from that day there is no looking back and I want to pursue my career in Computer Science. The concept of studying different computer languages has always made me eager to learn more about them and then practice these languages to build something better and intuitive.
										</p>
										
										<p> 
											Apart from books, I also love doing experiments hand-on. Like many other young students, my first ever science project was to light a little bulb. It works only if the circuit is complete and enables current flows. I was also fascinated by the solar energy and its usage which propelled me to make solar cars with the help of a mechanics set. I was so fascinated by the idea of making a car that in my spare time I used to sit for hours making the car. I have made several models like the solar car or the car which runs on battery, its design was so appealing that I used to call it my Mars rover!!! In pursuing such probing experiments, I received equal support from my parents who always encouraged me. And as a child I have always been very proud of it because the time and sweat I have given to it, resulted into a marvelous outcome. My small efforts in experimenting have been recognized  appreciated by my school mates, teachers and elders. Like the structure of an atom as proposed by J.J Thomson that the positive charge of the atom is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged electrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon!! I used to explain this to my little brother that from something like watermelon we humans have come a long way in knowing what actually atom is and how small its size is. </p>
										
										<p> 
											Despite the extra effort, I always feel that I take back more than I give, and managing all this along with academics is an exhilarating challenge. Also, I am very socially inclined and I feel that all human beings who have the privilege of a good education, are socially responsible to better the lives of those less fortunate than them. Environment around as is continuously being subjected to manmade changes. Pollution in the environment has been affecting all of us. I always feel that there is a need to spread awareness about keeping our surroundings neat and tidy. Here too, I have been deeply influenced by my father, who being the Indian Coast Guard officer, has been championing the cause of ensuring neat and clean beaches. I am conscious of the fact that large number of energy resources viz crude oil is transported through the Indian Ocean toward the far east and the US and almost 90 trade by volume is shipped through the oceans.  Therefore there is a strong need to check the marine pollution caused by the merchant marine. Towards this, I have been whole heartedly participating in the International Coastal Cleanup Day organized by the Indian Coast Guard to which my father serves with dignity and verve and have generated awareness about this campaign amongst the school children and the NGOs which are mobilized by the Indian Coast Guard every year. Its an effort, which in my opinion, pays rich dividends in ensuring neat and clean beaches and protection of marine environment which has the significant influence over the flora and fauna and I wish to continue the same in the years to come.
