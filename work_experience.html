										<p>It was a very informative and learning experience working for the team. We had a small team of like minded professional people. All belived in brainstorming issues together and giving valuable input to each other as and when needed. We also got great support from the prof. who would supervise us and give insights on how to deal with a situation at hand. It was a wonderful experience and I have learned so much during my internship. I am thankful for the opportunity that was provided to me by the University.</p>
